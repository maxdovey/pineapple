I"ú<p>H.I.T. stands for â€˜Human Intelligence Tasksâ€™ and refers to the human labour involved in the development of image recognition algorithms. To investigate the position of human labour in the production of algorithms, artists Max Dovey &amp; Manetta Berends have adapted an automatic image tagging application into a participatory game show with cash prizes. <br /> In the game show, multiple teams compete to identify the human labour involved in the development of an image recognition algorithm.</p>
