I"L<p>Agorama is a critical exploration of digital network culture through public events, residencies and collective research groups. Since July 2018 we have been located in Rebecca's flat at Raven Row in East London. We have been facilitating a community of practitioners interested in developing a p2p distributed Internet. We host meet-ups, publish code and deploy hardware to expand the possibilities of a decentralized Internet and develop a self-organized cloud-like infrastructure. <br /> See the <a href="https://home.agorama.org.uk/">Agorama website</a> for the latest updates.</p>
