The Secret Post Office is a festival mail service that circulates post around the festival. Letters and postcards made at the post office are delivered to anyone within the festival. This is a performance installation where the public create unique items of mail that are delivered to their friends at the festival. The affection towards our quaint village like post office and the popularity of our performing postmen peddling around the festival on bikes has been astounding. People genuinely recall their encounter with the secret posties as their favorite moment of the festival and this is echoed in articles, reviews and even a short interview on BBC Radio 4â€™s Today programme. </p>
