The Dial-up choir is a 0:36 second performance that adapts the sounds of a 56k dial-up Internet modem into a vocal sound performance. The original was the sound of the "handshake" between an analogue phone line converting to a digital signal. The group turns each tone into a vocal sound to re-enact the dial-up modem handshake. </p>
