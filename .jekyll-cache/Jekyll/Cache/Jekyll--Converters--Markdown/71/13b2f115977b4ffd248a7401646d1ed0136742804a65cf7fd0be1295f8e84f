Your Homepage is an interactive web documentary project about memory and locality. Participants discuss an address where they grew up in-front of the address on Google's street view. People talk about what they can see, how the place has changed (or how different it looks) and what they can remember. The collection of videos is navigated through the standard Google maps interface within the website. The work was commissioned by University Arts London and presented as an online map in the summer of 2012 </p>
