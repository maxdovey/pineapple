<a href="dat://dat-swarm.hashbase.io/">DAT Swarm</a> uses the DAT API to count how many people are seeding the website and visualizes the amount of people on the website with buzzing flies.
It was inspired by <a href="dat://sun.hashbase.io/">sunrise-sunset</a> by <a href="https://ollybromham.com">Olly Bromham</a> that similarly visualizes peers seeding a website. Please be aware that you need to install <a href="http://beakerbrowser.com/">Beaker Browser</a> to experience these websites.
