An Installation in which real time online content is streamed and printed according to emotional categorization. Modified receipt printers continuously print out tweets containing the words â€˜happyâ€™, â€˜sadâ€™ and â€˜loveâ€™. Tweets are sold by the performing stock brokers to the audience as shares in the emotion stock market. The audience then trade their tweets according to the share index of the emotion they have invested in. When the traders stop trading the installation automatically continues piling up unsold tweets. A website accompanies the project displaying the share index and value of each emotion that is being traded in the emotional stock market.  </p>
