A workshop game where participants learn how language is psychoanalyzed by companies and how to intentionally disturb and deceive psychometric software. Participants are asked to write texts using the Language Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) to intentionally subvert IBM's personality Insights analysis software that looks for keywords to identify characteristics using the OCEAN psychographic model . Each workshop reveals a different subtle method for adversarial writing and highlights the exhaustive personality and character matrix's used to develop psychographic software.
