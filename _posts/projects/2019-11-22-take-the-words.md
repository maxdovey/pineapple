<p><i>Take The Words Right Out Of My Mouth</i> is a performance that invites the audience to have a dialogue with themselves using an artificial clone of their voice. Using machine learning to replicate the human voice we aim to sonify the internal monologue of the individual and experiment with conversation mediums to amplify internal voices.

The performance was commissioned by Setup and made in collaboration with Nina Goedegebure. All images by <a href="http://www.sebastiaanterburg.nl/"> Sebastiaan ter Burg</a>.
