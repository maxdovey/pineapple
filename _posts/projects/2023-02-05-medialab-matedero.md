<p> <i> Considering electronic devices as geological artifacts, what stories and tales can be unearthed through embodied practices?</i>
<br>
<br>
I was project lead for a collaborative residency as part of ‘The Metabolic Sublime’ at Medialab Matedero for 2 weeks in February 2023.  
<br>
<br>
We workshopped process based methods for excavating minerals (such as dowsing, detecting and foraging) and designed lo-fi instruments with found materials to create embodied circuits of energy transfer and mythical enactment.
<br>
<br>
By evoking mythical tales associated with stones and minerals we developed a number of participatory methodologies for re-configuring humans relation to stones & technology and fostered new paradigms towards ‘clean’ energy.
