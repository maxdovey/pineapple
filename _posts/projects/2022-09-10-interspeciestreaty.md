<p> <i>The Treaty of Finsbury Park 2025</i> is a collaborative project that depicts the story of the dawning of interspecies democracy. 
<br>
<br>
Based around a set of LARPs – or live action role play games – the Treaty of Finsbury Park 2025 is played from more-than-human perspectives to encourage the blooming of a bountiful biodiversity and interspecies political action.
<br>
<br>
 I joined this large scale project as a collaborative artist and LARP host, hosting the online assemblies as my mentor species, Scirius (a North London Squirrel) and worked on the festival production for the live events in Finsbury Park.

The project was originally developed in a collaboration between Furtherfield and The New Design Congress. The first 3 years were supported by CreaTures Creative Practices for Transformational Futures.
