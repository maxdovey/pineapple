<p>Mining Cards is a collectable trading card series stored on the blockchain. Each card features a custom made mining rig together with its technical information, and like Top Trumps, they can be used to play and trade a gainst one another. The cards depict the material infrastructure of blockchain networks and show the often domestic environments where computer nodes are located. The mining rigs reveal the DIY engineering and amateur craft necessary to build a peer to peer, de-centralized computer network. Dovey collects the images from various online forums where hobbyists share pictures of their mining rig setups along with their instructions and technical specifications.</p>
