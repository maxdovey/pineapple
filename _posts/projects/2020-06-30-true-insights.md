<p><i>True Insights</i> is the name of a fictional focus group created as part of a series of live action role play events that critically examine the effects of decentralized technology. The focus group explored consumer ethics and attitudes towards data transparency in the style of a market research focus group. Each participant was allocated fictional personas and given pseudonyms with which they could enact a critical response to the increased use of data transparency and surveillance in society.
