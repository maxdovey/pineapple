<p>

Foley Narratives is a series of performances that (mis)uses speech translation software to infer the sonic properties of everyday objects into a piece of text. The text produced by the various objects and the speech translation software (Dragon Naturally Speaking version 14) is repeatedly read aloud by a performer in front of a live audience. <br><br>

Each performance is an improvisation between objects, speech to text technology and human audiences, the performer wrangles through slapstick interfaces in an absurd assemblage to create moments of meaning between humans and machine.<br><br>

Foley Narratives has been performed at Tent Rotterdam & Noordkaap Dordecht.
