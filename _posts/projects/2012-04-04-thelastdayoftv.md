<p>

The Last Day of TV was an event and group show organised to celebrate the end of analogue broadcasting in Uk in April 2012. The broadcasting medium that had served the Uk for over 70 years was quietly ceasing transmission. The event featured TV Dinners, Performances, and an exhibition curated collectively. In addition I produced a vhs box set documenting each TV Channel's last 24 hours of analouge broadcasting. The VHS box sets capture the moment Channels 1 -5 stopped broadcasting in the UK. </p>
