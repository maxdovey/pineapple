Banking with Grandad was a site specific event within the underground bank vaults under Donner Bookstore on Coolsingel, Rotterdam. The event featured an exhibition, a screening and a variety of performances related to money, religion and family history. The program featured a short teaser trailer of a film 'Petrol Dollars for a Different Engine' by Eline Hesse and a musical performance by Pau Marqu√®s I Oleo.
