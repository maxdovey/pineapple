A web app that sends a list of subscribers a random fluxus performance work once a week. The service selects an event score each week from the <a href="https://www.thing.net/~grist/ld/fluxusworkbook.pdf">The Fluxus Performance Workbook</a> (Performance Research e-publication, 2002) and features over 30 different artists and hundreds of event scores for peformative happenings. I hope that by sending them out via a mobile text service will mean these event scores can become occasional interruptions into our daily routines and offer performative actions and imagined events during periods of social isolation.
