<p>H.I.T. stands for ‘Human Intelligence Tasks’ and refers to the human labour involved in the development of image recognition algorithms. To investigate the position of human labour in the production of algorithms, artists Max Dovey & Manetta Berends have adapted an automatic image tagging application into a participatory game show with cash prizes. <br> In the game show, multiple teams compete to identify the human labour involved in the development of an image recognition algorithm.</p>
