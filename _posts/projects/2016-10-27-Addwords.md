<p>Addwords is a tool for predicting and forecasting the cost of placing advertisements on google search engine.  It was developed in collaboration with Manetta Barends and Lucia Dossinas part of The gig is Up exhibition at V2. The application was demonstrated as part of Cloud Labour Night in which each speakers presentation was transcribed, analysed, displayed and ordered according to market value. The ranking metrics used by Addwords provided insights into how each speaker's presentation could be more click worthy and the cost of advertising their lecture on Google.</p>
