In this workshop participants explored methods to produce locative based experiences as part of Noordkaap’s post-futuristic taxi rides. Participants were introduced to site specific media art and explored methods used by the Situationists and the mathematical literature group Oulipo to produce their own artworks and happenings that took place as part of the taxi ride <a href="/Cologne-Maiden-Name/">Cologne, What is Your Mother's Maiden Name?</a>
