<p>In this Situated Computing workshop students explore digital design methods for working with the Internet of Things. They develop concepts that make use of sensors, interactive computing and integrated digital design. Students build small electronic circuits using sensors that measure temperature, light, motion and biometrics and connect these devices to the Internet using raspberry pi computers. At the end of the workshop each student develops a working prototype for an interactive device that makes use of a digital sensor, electronic circuit, raspberry pi, command line and a bit of web development. Presentation slides are <a href="https://home.agorama.org.uk/projects/edu/">here</a> </p>
