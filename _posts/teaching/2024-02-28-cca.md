In conversation with Sammy Balogji's exhibition that explored legacies of colonialism in the Democratic republic of Congo, students explored tactile methods to animate narratives around copper extraction. Thinking about its role as a critical mineral and conductive metal in electronics students experimented with drawing copper specimens using different techniques before creating electronic circuits using lithium cell batteries & conductive frames. This workshop was delivered for 16 - 18yr olds in Lewisham as part of the educational outreach for <a href="https://goldsmithscca.art/exhibition/sammy-baloji/">Goldsmiths Centre for Contemporary Art (CCA)</a> and produced by <a href="https://linkedspheres.art/">Linked Spheres</a> with support from <a href="https://www.geolsoc.org.uk/">British Geology Society.</a> </p>
