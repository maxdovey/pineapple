<p>During this two day workshop students are introduced to methods for critically working with data and producing web based applications. The workshop includes a basic introduction to JSON and Application Protocal Interfaces (APIs) before students develop small interventions and hacks into web 2.0 using popular APIS such as Twitter, Facebook or Google.  </p>
