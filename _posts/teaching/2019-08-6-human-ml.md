<p>
In this 3 day workshop MA students explored the use of Machine Learning and produced some proof of concepts based on experimental data methods. The course examined machine learning through the history of 20th century experimental art practices such as Fluxus, Oulipo and the Situationists. Students were introduced to conceptual and technical approaches to working with machine learning in (un)creative and adverserial ways and produced some machine learning protypes using Python and TensorFlow.
