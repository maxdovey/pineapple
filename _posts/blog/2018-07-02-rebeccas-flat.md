Agorama is pleased to announce that we have been selected to be one of 10 residence based at Raven Row gallery! We are extremely pleased at this turn of events and honour to have been selected.

We have been situated on the 4th floor of the historical building in *Rebecca's Flat* - a visually eccentric space with loads of character.

During our years tenancy in the space we will be driving to create a sustainable community with p2p technology at its core. Just think antique switch boards and DIY networks!

Stay tune for more news, events and workshops over at our site [Agorama](https://home.agorama.org.uk)
