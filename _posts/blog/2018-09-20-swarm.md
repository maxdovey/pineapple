<a href="dat://dat-swarm.hashbase.io/">DAT Swarm</a> uses the DAT API to count how many people are seeding the website and visualizes the amount of people on the website with buzzing flies.
It was inspired by [sunrise-sunset](dat://sun.hashbase.io/) by [Olly Bromham](https://ollybromham.com) that similarly visualizes peers seeding a website. Please be aware that you need to install [Beaker Browser](http://beakerbrowser.com/) to experience these websites.
