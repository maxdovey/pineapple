<p>Agora Club was a live event series done in collaboration with The University of the Underground. Named after the Greek Antiquity method of teaching in public 'Agora Club' was an experimental performance evening that explored the act of thinking, the unconscious and the politics of social dreaming. The events bought together philosophers, scientists, DJS, performance artists and the students to collectively perform the act of thinking </p>
