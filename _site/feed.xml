In this 3 day workshop MA students explored the use of Machine Learning and produced some proof of concepts based on experimental data methods. The course examined machine learning through the history of 20th century experimental art practices such as Fluxus, Oulipo and the Situationists. Students were introduced to conceptual and technical approaches to working with machine learning in (un)creative and adverserial ways and produced some machine learning protypes using Python and TensorFlow.

Members of the public were asked play ‘ispy’ and record their experience during their taxi ride as they explored different parts of the city. These written observations were then analysed for their psychometric properties, similar to the techniques used by companies such as Cambridge Analytica to target consumers in online advertising and political campaigning to produce a psycho-geography of the city.
